# ChessAI

* This project done in the scope of __Reinforcement Learning (RL)__ for the Data Science and Advanced Analytics in Nova IMS, Lisbon. The goal is to create RL agents that can play chess at a hight level of proficiency, being capable of chess positions evaluation and strategic decision making. We decided to go a little further and instead of using the `chess` module to incorporate these algorithms, we opted to design our own chess game.

__IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROCESS__

---
## Objectives

* Optimize decision-making using RL algorithms: Explore different RL algorithms, as seen in class, to
train the agent. Compare and analyse their effectiveness in learning and decision-making
capabilities in the context of chess.
* Use a challenging chess environment: Use a comprehensive environment for the agent to interact
with, representing the rules and dynamics of chess. This environment will provide a realistic and
challenging setting for the agent's training and evaluation.
* Evaluate and benchmark performance: Assess the performance of the RL agent against different
benchmarks from an existing chess engine (Stockfish). 

---
## Extra Objectives:
* Investigate transfer learning and generalization: Explore techniques for transfer learning to
leverage knowledge acquired in related domains or from pre-training on large chess datasets.
Investigate the agent's ability to generalize its knowledge.
* Enhance interpretability and analysis: Develop methods to analyse the agent's decision-making
process and provide insights into its strategic thinking. Investigate techniques to visualize the
agent's evaluation of chess positions and understand its reasoning behind specific moves.

## Configurations:

* To run: app.py

* Press 'r' to restart the game

* Press 'DOWN'/'UP' to choose the AI Agent then press 'ENTER' to select

## WIP

WIP - Turn is implemented, although we always beggin with white turn, if time implement choose player color

1 - Pawn Promotion
Update:
    Pawn promotions is implemented just finish choise in menu
    Menu is also implemented
    It is by default Queen

2 - King Bug
Update:
    King eat king only

3 - RL Algorithms
Update:
    New file "ai_agents_models.py" is already working


4 - Menu Art
Update:
    Missing the agent selection retrieve the agent selected

5 - Different Sounds

6 - Checkmate end game
